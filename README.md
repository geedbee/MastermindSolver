**Project**

Create a Mastermind solver that will:

1) Play: Allow the user to play on their own by generating a random solution, and checking each of the userâ€™s inputs automatically
Option: Tell the user the optimal next guess

2) Solve: Allow the user to input their guesses and feedback. Then, suggest the next best possible guess (solver for an already running game)

3) Info: Explain algorithm so that it is easy to understand

**Code**

Tech Stack: React, Typescript
