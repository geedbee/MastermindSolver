Project
Create a Mastermind solver that will:
Play: Allow the user to play on their own by generating a random solution, and checking each of the userâ€™s inputs automatically
Option: List all Knuth_codes
Option: List all possible_codes (unguessed)
Option: List all guess_codes
Solve: Allow the user to input their guesses and feedback. Then, suggest the next best possible guess (solver for an already running game)
